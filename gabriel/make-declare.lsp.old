;; You may wish to adjust the following to output the proclamations
;; for inclusion in a file.  All fixed arg functions should be proclaimed
;; before their references for maximum efficiency.

;; CAVEAT: The following code only checks for fixed args, it does
;; not check for single valuedness BUT does make a proclamation
;; to that efect.  Unfortunately it is impossible to tell about
;; multiple values without doing a full compiler type pass over 
;; all files in the relevant system.   AKCL supports doing such a pass
;; during the compilation of a system, and can thus produce proclaims for
;; a subsequent compilation.  [see emit-fn documentation].
