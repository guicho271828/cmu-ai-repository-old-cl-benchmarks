I added some more optimizers to fix things I noticed--wfs.


browse.cl Errors in code: There was an eq char compare test which
should have been eql for common lisp.  Corrected this.

akcl run time  : 25.500 secs
with
(allocate-relocatable-pages 70)
(allocate 'cons 1300 t)
(allocate 'symbol 200 t)
Lucid time 27 seconds (about 4 meg of space allocated).

-----------------


traverse init
run time  : 4.200 secs
traverse run
run time  : 34.950 secs

lucid:
Total cpu time = 4460 milliseconds
Total cpu time = 34920 milliseconds


-------------------------


deriv

For lucid:
(time (dotimes (i 5) (testderiv)))
Total cpu time = 35480 milliseconds

kcl:
(allocate 'cons 2000 t)
(time (dotimes (i 5) (testderiv)))
run time  : 33.167 secs
I did  at the start which seemed to be roughly
what lucid was grabbing.   It gc'd several times in both implementations.

ps:
run time  : 49.300 secs instead of 33.2 secs. in the old akcl.


------------------

I changed the fixnum declarations for the three arrays a b c,
and the function try.  These actually slowed lucid down,
so we include the times for lucid using its own declarations.

triang-mod.cl  

kcl:  run time  : 137.850 secs
on triang.cl
lucid: Total cpu time = 136940 milliseconds
On triang-mod.cl
lucid: Total cpu time = 258900 milliseconds

(kcl using the lucid declarations was around 234. seconds I think)
